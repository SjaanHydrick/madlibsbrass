            <p>On the far-away <span id="geographic-feature"></span> of <span id="place-name"></span>,
            <span id="name"></span> was <span id="noun1"></span> of the <span id="noun2"></span>.
            <br>A nice little <span id="noun2-1"></span>.  It was clean.  It was neat.
            <br>The water was <span id="adjective"></span>.  There was plenty to <span id="verb"></span>.
            <br>The <span id="animal"></span>s had everything <span id="animal2"></span>s might need.
            <br>And they were all <span id="emotion"></span>.  Quite <span id="emotion2"></span> indeed.</p>
        
            <p> They were...until <span id="name-2"></span>, the <span id="noun1-2"></span> of them all,
            <br>Decided the <span id="setting"></span> he ruled was too <span id="size"></span>.
            <br>"I'm <span id="poa"></span>", said <span id="name-3"></span>, "of all that I see.
            <br>But I don't see enough.  That's the <span id="adjective2"></span> with me.
            <br>With this <span id="noun3"></span> for a <span id="sitting"></span>, I look down on my <span id="noun2-2"></span>.
            <br>But I cannot look down on the <span id="noun4"></span> beyond.
            <br>This <span id="sitting2"></span> that I sit on is too, too low down.
            <br>It ought to be higher!" he said with a <span id="facialexpression"></span>.
            <br>"If I could sit high, how much greater I'd be!
            <br>What a <span id="noun1-3"></span>! I'd be <span id="poa2"></span> of all that I see!"
