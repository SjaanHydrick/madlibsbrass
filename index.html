    <p id="">On the far-away <span id="geographic-feature"></span> of <span id="place-name"></span>,
        <span id="name"></span> was <span id="noun1"></span> of the <span id="noun2"></span>.
        A nice little <span id="noun2"></span>.  It was clean.  It was neat.
        The water was <span id="adjective"></span>.  There was plenty to <span id="verb"></span>.
        The <span id="animal"></span>s had everything <span id="animal"></span>s might need.
        And they were all happy.  Quite happy indeed.

        Decided the kingdom he ruled was too small.
        "I'm ruler", said <span id="name-3"></span>, "of all that I see.
        But I don't see enough.  That's the trouble with me.

        But I cannot look down on the places beyond.
        This throne that I sit on is too, too low down.
        It ought to be higher!" he said with a frown.
        "If I could sit high, how much greater I'd be!
        What a <span id="noun1-3"></span>! I'd be ruler of all that I see!"
